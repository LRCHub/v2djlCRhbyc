I don't know what it is
That makes me love you so
I only know
I never want to let you go
'Cos you've started something
Can't you see
That ever since we've met
You've had a hold on me
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you
It doesn't matter where you go
Or what you do
I'd love to spend
Each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened
You just walked in
I never knew that I could be in
love like this
It's crazy but it's true
I only wanna be with you
You stopped,you smile at me
And asked me if I'd care to
dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
Now listen honey
I just wanna be beside you
everywhere
As long as we're together,honey
I don't care
'Cos you started something
Now can't you see
That ever since we've met
You've had a hold on me
Now matter what you do
I only wanna be with you
You stopped,you smile at me
And asked me if I'd care to
dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
Now listen honey
I just wanna be beside you
everywhere
As long as we're together,honey
I don't care
'Cos you started something
Now can't you see
That ever since we've met
You've had a hold on me
Now matter what you do
I only wanna be with you
No matter,No matter what you do
I only wanna be with you
No matter,No matter what you do
I only wanna be with you
